Always
======
*a JavaScript (node.js) testing framework*

Intro
-----
Always is a JavaScript testing framework built on node.js. It is being written primarily as a way for me to explore the area of JavaScript testing, but also as an attempt to try to keep things as simple as possible without obfuscation, to avoid introducing any psuedo-language when writing tests and in general make the barrier for writing tests as thin as possible.


Status
------
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/silverbucket/always-test.png)](http://travis-ci.org/silverbucket/always-test)
Always is not feature complete, is still very much a research project and should be considered in alpha state.
