Always
======
*a JavaScript (node.js) testing framework*

Intro
-----
Always is a JavaScript testing framework built on node.js. It is being written primarily as a way for me to explore the area of JavaScript testing, but also as an attempt to either do away, or come to terms, with the psuedo-language surrounding most existing testing frameworks. A lot of the more popular frameworks try to simplify things, but often introduce a lot of new terms and unecessary absraction in doing so. This over-simplification can actually create a larger barrier for developers just starting out with testing.

Always is a naive attempt to keep things simple and not introduce any new concepts aside from the bare minimum. Each test is a JSON object. You use the same JavaScript skills you already have to write the tests and there is no flow like 'describe', 'it' etc. common in other test frameworks.


Status
------
[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/silverbucket/always.png)](http://travis-ci.org/silverbucket/always)
Always is not feature complete, is still very much a research project and should be considered in alpha state.
