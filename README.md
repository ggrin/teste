= Always Testing

- Intro
Always is a JavaScript testing framework build on node.js. It is being written first as a way to explore the area of testing, but also to either do away, or come to terms, with the psuedo-language surrounding most existing testing framerworks. This psuedo-language requires developers to learn a new way of doing things when it comes to testing, this over-simplification can actually create a larger barrier for developers just starting out with testing.

A developer wants tests to be an easy and helpful addition to their project, they don't want to have to learn new ways of doing things, struggle with semantics and a new language of terms, they just want to write tests in the language they are already using for their project.

Always attempts to address this niche. Each test is a JSON object. You use the same JavaScript skills you already have to write the tests and there is no flow like 'describe', 'it' etc.


- Status
Always is still very much a research project and should be considered in alpha state.
